"captcha.module:30","""CAPTCHA"" is an acronym for ""Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"". It is typically a challenge-response test to determine whether the user is human. The CAPTCHA module is a tool to fight automated submission by malicious users (spamming) of for example comments forms, user registration forms, guestbook forms, etc. You can extend the desired forms with an additional challenge, which should be easy for a human to solve correctly, but hard enough to keep automated scripts and spam bots out.","","","False","","",""
